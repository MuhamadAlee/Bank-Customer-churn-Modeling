# Bank-Customer-churn-Modeling
In this project we are going to use Classification for the prediction of Chrun Modeling weather customer is going to leave the bank or not based on the several features available in the dataset.

 step 1 : Firstly we will try to select some of the important features from the dataset so that it can help us to predict the results accurately.

 step 2 : Then we will perform feature engineering on the selected feaures also removing outliers and then making the dummy variables for the category features.

 step 3 : Then we have performed Standard scalling over this whole dataset for better classifictaion.
 
 step 4 : We will then going to apply the Deep Learning Algorithm of Artificial Neural Network for classification.

 step 5 : Based on the trained models we can simply preict the new datapoint for the car's selling price based on the condition.
